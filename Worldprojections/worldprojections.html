    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>In working with this map, I first tested out QGIS and the Indicatrix Mapper by inputting the map and projections of the two given examples. 
        This allowed me to test for myself the tools in use and to compare them with the examples to ensure I was using the tools properly.
        I then utilized a fresh map with each successive projection, applying the Indicatrix Mapper each time, and adjusting my colors to remain as consistent as possible.
        Ultimately, once I understood the process, I was able to create new maps with the proper elements within minutes.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is fairly accurate the closer in distance and the closer to the equator one looks. 
        Proceeding to the poles, horizontal stretching exaggerates the size of areas such as Greenland, Russia, or Antarctica far beyond reality. 
        Shapes and sizes are therefore more accurate in say central Africa or South America than they are in Northern Europe.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map strives to maintain accuracy in the size of features relative to other areas of the planet, but at the cost of vertical distortion towards the poles.
        Features like Greenland or Antarctica are not as overly exaggerated as in other projections, nonetheless they suffer from this vertical stretching.
        Areas around the equator also begin to distort vertically closer to the international date line, though not to the same degree as the poles.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Pseudo Mercator remains accurate at the equator, with shapes and sizes stretching horizontally as one goes north or south.
        Once again, polar features are made to appear much larger than they are in real life, though the distance between them appears consistent.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel Sphere Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel Sphere Projection strives to minimize all factors of distortion, and largely succeeds in projecting accurate shapes, size, and distance.
        As with other projections, the greatest area of distortion lies in stretching at the poles, which though not as extreme as in other cases, is nonetheless extant.</h3>

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map seeks to keep the relative size and area of features consistent relative to other parts of the world.
        Consequently, horizontal stretching or squishing becomes extreme at the poles in order to compensate for this equalized area.
        Other features remain fairly accurate in shape, until the poles are reached.</h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection takes a polar approach, with areas closest to the North Pole remaining accurate relative to each other in shape and size.
        Radiating out from this pole however, vertical and horizontal stretching increases until some features, such as Australia, are made to appear many times larger.
        Lastly, the stretching becomes so extreme at the south pole that this projection sees Antarctica turned into a ring-like feature that encapsulates the rest of the world.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection also establishes the north pole as its center, with the rest of the planet stretching out from there.
        Compared to the Conic Projection, its horizontal stretching appears slightly more exaggerated as one approaches the south pole.
        Antarctica once again becomes a world-encompassing ring. </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Equidistant Cylindrical Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection strives to maintain an accurate depiction of distance at the expense of shape.
        Features at the equator become vertically strecthed, consistent along latitude, while polar features, though exaggerated horizontally to appear much larger than normal, are accurate relative to each other.</h3>

    <h2>Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similarly to the Winkel Sphere projection, the Robinson seeks to minimize distortion in all measurements.
        It succeeds fairly well in this task, but nonetheless distortion exists as one approaches either pole.
        Distances between points remain consistent, but shape becomes stretched horizontally, once again making Greenland, Russia, or Antarctica significantly larger than many of the world's regions.</h3>
